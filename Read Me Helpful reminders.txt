Quick Instructions

Setup:

Install Node Software (this acts as a server that runs your app)
Goto the directory of the app.js file in windows command line.
from the directory use

	 'npm install -d' to install all elements mentioned 

in the 'package.json' file
type 'node app' to run app. (it appears at node.exe in running processes)
CRTL+C in the command line window will gracefully close node.exe / the webserver.

Adding Webpages:

Create a public folder next to the app.js file, this becomes the ROOT webdirectory.
Create an Index.html / any other webpages there.
The name of the webpages folder is defined in the app.js file

	var dirPublic = path.join( __dirname, "public" );
	app.use( express.static( dirPublic ) );

Testing Website:

Visit The website by going to localhost in a browser. This Particular site
(as configured in package.json) is on port 4000. So entering localhost:4000 will open
the index.html page.




Webpage Notes:

	| at the begining of a line means 'append' to above if something is appended to a 'strong.id' object it will move the text over by certain abount of pixels

	- at the begining of the line means treat everything after it (and anything indented after it) as inline code.
